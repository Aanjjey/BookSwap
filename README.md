# BookSwap

Frontend repo for the BookSwap project.

Can find the [backend here](https://github.com/Aanjjey/BookSwap-backend)

BookSwap is an Android mobile application that allows students to share unused books in their institution.

The project was done with user-driven development in mind, meaning that all UI/UX components, as well as required features, were consulted with real users before implementation. Therefore, more than 20 interviews were conducted before the final solution was made.

The project was done with Android Studio and Kotlin for the Design for Real People course at Imperial College London.
